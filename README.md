# **Energy, GDP, and Scientific Contributions Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves data cleaning and analysis of a merged dataset, including energy supply, GDP, and journal contribution data. It explores the relationships between energy consumption, economic growth, and scientific output, focusing on the top 15 ranked countries. Data manipulation, joining datasets, and creating new calculated fields are performed to extract key insights. Visualizations and correlation analysis support the findings and recommendations.

## **Key Features**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Merging multiple datasets to create a unified view.
- Creating new calculated columns for additional insights.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Data visualization using Python libraries to present findings.
- Correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Insights and recommendations based on data-driven conclusions.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration and visualization
- **SQL** (if applicable): Querying and managing structured data
- **Excel/CSV**: Data storage and preprocessing

## **Dataset Sources**
